# Security Policy

## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

The DumpFun team takes security seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose security vulnerabilities.

### üö® Please DO NOT:
- Open public GitHub issues for security vulnerabilities
- Discuss potential vulnerabilities in public forums
- Attempt to exploit vulnerabilities on mainnet

### ‚úÖ Please DO:
- Report vulnerabilities through responsible disclosure
- Provide detailed information about the vulnerability
- Allow reasonable time for fixes before public disclosure

## How to Report

### Preferred Method: Private Communication
Send details to: **oluwadarasimiadedigba1@gmail.com**

1. **Vulnerability Description**: Clear explanation of the issue
2. **Attack Vector**: How the vulnerability could be exploited
3. **Impact Assessment**: Potential damage or risk level
4. **Proof of Concept**: Code or steps to reproduce (if safe)
5. **Suggested Fix**: Your recommended solution (if any)

### Report Template:

## Security Scope

### In Scope:
- **Smart Contract Logic**: Bonding curve calculations, state management
- **Access Controls**: Account validation, PDA security
- **Mathematical Operations**: Overflow/underflow protection
- **Economic Attacks**: MEV, front-running, price manipulation
- **Account Security**: Improper account validation
- **Integration Vulnerabilities**: Issues with SPL tokens, Metaplex metadata

### Out of Scope:
- **Client-side vulnerabilities** in example frontend code
- **Third-party dependencies** (report to respective projects)
- **Network-level attacks** on Solana itself
- **Social engineering** attacks
- **Physical security** of user devices

## Vulnerability Categories

### Critical Severity
- **Funds at Risk**: Direct loss of user funds
- **Unauthorized Minting**: Ability to mint unlimited tokens
- **Reserve Manipulation**: Draining bonding curve reserves
- **Access Control Bypass**: Unauthorized administrative actions

### High Severity
- **Price Manipulation**: Significant impact on token pricing
- **Denial of Service**: Preventing normal contract operations
- **State Corruption**: Inconsistent or invalid contract state
- **Fee Evasion**: Bypassing platform fees

### Medium Severity
- **Logic Errors**: Incorrect calculations with limited impact
- **Validation Issues**: Improper input validation
- **Event Inconsistencies**: Incorrect or missing event data

### Low Severity
- **Gas Inefficiencies**: Suboptimal gas usage
- **Code Quality**: Non-security code improvements
- **Documentation Issues**: Security-related documentation gaps

## Response Timeline

We aim to respond to security reports within:
- **24 hours**: Initial acknowledgment
- **72 hours**: Preliminary assessment
- **7 days**: Detailed analysis and response plan
- **30 days**: Fix implementation and testing (for valid reports)

## Security Measures

### Current Protections
- **Input Validation**: All parameters validated before processing
- **Overflow Protection**: Safe math operations throughout
- **Access Controls**: PDA-based authority management
- **Slippage Protection**: User-configurable slippage tolerance
- **State Consistency**: Comprehensive state validation
- **Event Auditing**: All operations emit detailed events

### Ongoing Security Practices
- **Code Reviews**: All changes reviewed by multiple developers
- **Testing**: Comprehensive test suite including edge cases
- **Static Analysis**: Regular code analysis for potential issues
- **Dependency Updates**: Regular updates of dependencies
- **Community Audits**: Open source enables community security review

## Security Considerations for Users

### For Token Creators:
- **Private Key Security**: Keep your creator keys secure
- **Metadata URIs**: Ensure metadata URIs are permanent and secure
- **Fee Planning**: Account for initialization fees before launching

### For Traders:
- **Slippage Settings**: Use appropriate slippage tolerance
- **Transaction Simulation**: Test transactions on devnet first
- **Private Key Safety**: Never share your private keys
- **Phishing Protection**: Always verify contract addresses

### For Integrators:
- **Account Validation**: Verify all account addresses
- **Error Handling**: Implement proper error handling
- **Transaction Monitoring**: Monitor for failed transactions
- **User Education**: Educate users about risks and best practices

## Bug Bounty Program

### Status: Under Consideration
We are evaluating the implementation of a bug bounty program. Details will be announced if/when a program is established.

### Potential Rewards:
- **Critical**: Significant recognition and potential rewards
- **High**: Public acknowledgment and thanks
- **Medium/Low**: Recognition in project credits

## Audit Status

### Current Status: Community Audited
This project is open source and relies on community review. We encourage:
- **Independent security reviews** by community members
- **Formal audits** by security firms (community funded)
- **Continuous monitoring** of deployed contracts

### Audit History:
*No formal audits completed yet - seeking community security reviews*

## Security Updates

### Notification Channels:
- **GitHub Security Advisories**: Official vulnerability announcements
- **README Updates**: Security-related changes documented
- **Release Notes**: Security fixes highlighted in releases

### Update Process:
1. **Vulnerability Assessment**: Evaluate impact and severity
2. **Fix Development**: Implement and test security fixes
3. **Community Notification**: Announce security updates
4. **Deployment Coordination**: Coordinated disclosure and deployment
