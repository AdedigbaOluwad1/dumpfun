## Smart Contract Security

### Security Considerations
When contributing to smart contract code:
- **Audit mathematical operations** for overflow/underflow
- **Validate all inputs** and account constraints
- **Test edge cases** thoroughly
- **Consider economic attacks** and MEV implications
- **Follow Solana best practices** for account validation

### Reporting Security Issues
**DO NOT** open public issues for security vulnerabilities. Please see our [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for responsible disclosure guidelines.

## Community Guidelines

### Be Respectful
- **Use welcoming language** and be patient with newcomers
- **Provide constructive feedback** and helpful suggestions
- **Respect different perspectives** and experience levels
- **Focus on the code/idea**, not the person

### Communication Channels
- **GitHub Issues**: Bug reports, feature requests
- **GitHub Discussions**: General questions, ideas, community chat
- **Pull Requests**: Code contributions and reviews
